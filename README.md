# Root Cause Analysis for Multivariate Sensor Faults in Heavy Vehicles 

This project detects sensor faults and anomalies in Scania trucks' Air Pressure System using Z-Score and Random Forest. It also identifies the root cause sensors using feature importance and includes a GUI for user interaction.

Features
- Anomaly detection using Z-Score
- Classification using Random Forest
- Root cause sensor identification
- GUI for file upload and analysis
- Visualizations for class distribution, correlation, and sensor behavior

Technologies
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, tkinter
